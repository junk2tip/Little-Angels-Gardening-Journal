# Little Gardener's Journal - Download Guide

To keep a copy of your garden journal app, you can save these key files:

## Main Project Files

1. **App Source Code**: All the files in client/src/ and server/ folders
2. **Database Code**: All the database files (schema.ts, db.ts, postgres-storage.ts)
3. **Configuration Files**: package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.

## How to Download

### Method 1: GitHub
The easiest way is to connect this project to a GitHub repository:
1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one
2. Click the "Version Control" icon in Replit (looks like a branch)
3. Connect to GitHub and create a new repository
4. Your code will be saved there and can be downloaded anytime

### Method 2: Export Individual Files
If you're having trouble with the .zip download:
1. Right-click on important files and select "Download" one by one
2. Start with these key files:
   - client/src/App.tsx
   - client/src/main.tsx
   - client/src/context/AccessibilityContext.tsx
   - server/index.ts
   - server/db.ts
   - shared/schema.ts

### Method 3: Copy to Another Replit
1. Create a new Replit project
2. Copy and paste the code from this project
3. This gives you a second copy you can work with

## Hosting Your Garden Journal

When you're ready to host the garden journal online:
